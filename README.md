# 🦠 Pandemic Patterns: COVID-19 Analytics for India  
**SQL | Excel | Data Analysis | Dashboarding**

## 📌 Overview
End-to-end COVID-19 analytics project analyzing **cases, testing, vaccination, recovery, and risk patterns** across Indian states using **SQL for ETL** and **Excel for analysis & dashboards**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – ETL, joins, feature engineering  
- **Microsoft Excel** – PivotTables, formulas, forecasting (ETS), dashboards  

---

## 🔄 What I Did
- Built a **SQL ETL pipeline** to integrate case, testing & vaccination datasets
- Engineered key metrics:
  - Daily new cases (LAG)
  - Test positivity rate
  - Case Fatality Rate (CFR)
  - Vaccination & recovery rates
  - Risk classification (High / Medium / Low)
- Created a **clean analytical dataset (`covid_summary`)**
- Performed **state-wise, time-series & correlation analysis**
- Designed an **interactive Excel dashboard** with slicers & forecasts

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- COVID-19 impact varied significantly by state
- Higher testing → higher detected cases
- Vaccination reduced severity and risk over time
- Recovery rates remained consistently high nationwide
- Anomalies were **episodic, not systemic**
- Forecasting highlights rising uncertainty over time

---

## 📈 Deliverables
- SQL-generated analytical dataset  
- Interactive Excel dashboard  
- Time-series forecasting & risk analysis
